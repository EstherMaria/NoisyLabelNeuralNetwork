# Re-implementation of Bekker &amp; Goldbergers Noisy Label Neural Network

Run experiment with:

$ python NNLNonMNIST.py [-pretrain] [-EM] [-plot]

One, two or all of three flags required.

-pretrain   trains neural networks on noisy data (noise fractions predetermined)

-EM         runs an EM module based on aforementioned models

-plot       !!!currently only prints rather than plots results!!!
